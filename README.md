# Weekend SQL To-Do List


## Description

- _Time spent learning SQL, how to use Postico, and full stack interactivity: about 4 days_
- _Time to execute the project, start to finish: ~15 hours_

This was our first project to make a full stack web app from scratch! I created all the files from the ground up.

The objective was to achieve all CRUD operations across the full stack, allowing a user to create new to-do list items that will display immediately, update them as 'completed,' and delete them individually both from the DOM and the database.

In the end I created an interface I like, and decent baseline functionality. I was not able to figure out how to get the dropdown buttons working with Bootstrap, so their 'input' is currently hardcoded for new inputs from the DOM. I also would like to have gotten to form validation, but I ran out of time.
